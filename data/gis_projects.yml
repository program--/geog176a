      - title: Tracking COVID-19 Data
        desc:
          - Parsed real-world data using tidyverse functions and plotted using ggplot2.
          - Used statistical methods for analyzing confirmed COVID-19 cases.
          - Analyzed COVID-19’s weighted mean center travel across the United States.

      - title: Analyzing Spatial Data in the US
        desc:
          - Gathered spatial data about US cities and their relation to national borders using tidyverse and sf libraries.
          - Used gghighlight and ggplot2 to visualize spatial data, and sf to calculate distances.
          - Analyzed controversial Federal Agencies’ claims based on an [ACLU article](https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone) to verify statistics given.

      - title: Point-in-Polygon Analysis with Tessellations
        desc:
          - "Generated and analyzed tessellated spatial datasets, such as: square and hexagonal coverages, Voronoi tessellations, and Delaunay triangulation."
          - Performed point-in-polygon analysis using US Dams dataset from US Army Corps of Engineers.
          - Created a leaflet interactive map to analyze dams at risk for floods along the Mississippi river system.

      - title: Flood Analysis using Remote Sensing
        desc:
          - Using Landsat Data generated rasters and computed band combinations for surface water features.
          - Utilized statistical methods, namely k-means clustering to highlight potential flood areas.
          - Applied flood data to visually identify at-risk areas using leaflet/mapview.

        desc:
          - Pulled data from the USGS and OpenStreetMap to assess the flood risk of buildings near a river system.
          - Used whitebox to create a Height Above Nearest Drainage raster for a specific AOI.
          - Created a Flood Inudation Map Library to observe flood impact on surrounding buildings.
