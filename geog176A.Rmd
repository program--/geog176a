In the summer of 2020 I took a class GIS course based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links! 

# [`r fa("code")` Building a project website](https://github.com/program--/geog176a)

  - For this assignment, we built a static website using **Rmarkdown**.
  - Includes a project github repository for access, view it [here](https://github.com/program--/geog176a) or by clicking on the above header.
  - Deployed project site as separate repo from main website repo using **Netlify**.

# [`r fa("chart-bar")` Tracking COVID-19 Data](https://geog176a.justinsingh.me/labs/lab-02)
  
  - Parsed real-world data using **tidyverse** functions and plotted using **ggplot2**.
  - Used statistical methods for analyzing confirmed COVID-19 cases.
  - Analyzed COVID-19's weighted mean center travel across the United States.

# [`r fa("globe-americas")` Analyzing Spatial Data in the US](https://geog176a.justinsingh.me/labs/lab-03)

  - Gathered spatial data about US cities and their relation to national borders using **tidyverse** and **sf** libraries.
  - Used **gghighlight** and **ggplot2** to visualize spatial data, and **sf** to calculate distances.
  - Analyzed controversial Federal Agencies' claims based on an [ACLU article](https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone) to verify statistics given.

# [`r fa("cubes")` Point-in-Polygon Analysis with Tessellations](https://geog176a.justinsingh.me/labs/lab-04)

  - Generated and analyzed **tessellated spatial datasets**, such as: *square* and *hexagonal coverages*, *Voronoi tessellations*, and *Delaunay triangulation*.
  - Performed **point-in-polygon** analysis using US Dams dataset from US Army Corps of Engineers.
  - Created a **leaflet** interactive map to analyze dams at risk for floods along the Mississippi river system.

# [`r fa_object_group()` Flood Analysis using Remote Sensing](https://geog176a.justinsingh.me/labs/lab-05)

  - Using **Landsat Data**, generated **rasters** and computed band combinations for surface water features.
  - Utilized statistical methods, namely **k-means clustering** to highlight potential flood areas.
  - Applied flood data to visually identify at-risk areas using **leaflet/mapview**.

# [`r fa("exclamation-triangle")` Flood Risk in Mission Creek: Past, Present, Future](https://geog176a.justinsingh.me/labs/lab-06)

  - Pulled data from the *USGS* and *OpenStreetMap* to assess the **flood risk** of buildings near a river system.
  - Used **whitebox** to create a **Height Above Nearest Drainage** raster for a specific **AOI**.
  - Created a **Flood Inudation Map Library** to observe flood impact on surrounding buildings.
