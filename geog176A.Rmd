## [`r fa("code")` Building a project website](https://github.com/program--/geog176a)

  - For this assignment, we built a static website using **Rmarkdown**.
  - Includes a project github repository for access, view it [here](https://github.com/program--/geog176a) or by clicking on the above header.
  - Deployed project site as separate repo from main website repo using **Netlify**.
