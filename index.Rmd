Hi! Welcome to my project site for GEOG176A: Introduction to GIS.

A little information about me:

  - I'm a senior at UCSB majoring in **Mathematics** with a minor in **Spatial Science**.
  - I'm a **Systems Administrator** and **Project Manager** for the *US Air Force Reserves*.
  - I like to compete in **orienteering** (`r fa("map")` + `r fa("compass")`), which started my initial interest in geography!

I participated in the UCSB Math department's annual Directed Reading Program, you can check out the presentation my group did on *elliptic curve cryptography* [here](https://ucsbdrp.weebly.com/2020-posters.html)!

If you ever need to contact me, feel free to email me at [justin@justinsingh.me](mailto:justin@justinsingh.me) or [justinsingh-mohudpur@ucsb.edu](mailto:justinsingh-mohudpur@ucsb.edu).
